## Tariff Context (August 2025)

Tariffs in 2025 have surged to their highest levels in nearly a century.

- **Overall average import tax**: ~18.6%, the highest since 1933 :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **China**: Tariffs fluctuated drastically—from 34% to highs of 145%, then temporarily reduced to 30% as part of a 90-day trade truce :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **India & Brazil**: Facing steep 50% tariffs as of August 7, 2025, in retaliation for trade actions :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Steel, Aluminum, Copper**: Under Section 232, these materials now face flat 50% tariffs :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Consumer impact**: Average U.S. household sees about $2,400 in added costs; clothing and shoes prices are up 17–40% :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **De minimis exemption removed**: Beginning August 29, all low-value imports (<$800) will now be subject to tariffs, affecting small exporters and platforms like Etsy :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **Legal challenges**: Federal courts have blocked some emergency-based tariffs as exceeding presidential authority under IEEPA :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
